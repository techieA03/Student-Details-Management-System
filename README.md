🧑‍🎓 Student Details Program in C
A simple, menu-driven C program to manage student records interactively. This project allows users to enter, view, and analyze student data such as name, roll number, class, and marks.

🚀 Features
Enter multiple student records interactively

Display all stored student details

Calculate and display total and average marks

User-friendly menu with looped options

Clean output formatting for better readability

📋 How It Works
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit. It offers four options:

Enter Student Data

Input name, roll number, class, and marks for each student

Continue entering data until the user chooses to stop

Display Student Data

Shows all entered student records in a formatted layout

Average & Total Marks

Calculates and displays the total and average marks of all students

Exit

Ends the program gracefully

🛠️ Code Highlights
Uses arrays to store up to 100 student records

Employs do-while and switch-case for menu control

Boolean flag (continue_entry) for interactive input loop

Clean separation of logic for input, display, and calculations
